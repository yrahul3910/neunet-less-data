* `01 - Lower data in DL.ipynb`: Elementary tries on using DBSCAN to reduce data and feed it to a neural net.
* `02 - Full experiments.ipynb`: Elaborate experiments based on the above concept.
* `data-orig.pkl`: Pickled unscaled data. Contains full and subset of data.
* `data.pkl`: Pickled normalized data. Contains full and subset of data.
* `ScottKnott.Rmd`: An R notebook to compute Scott-Knott results of the above experiments using the `ScottKnottESD` package.
* `ScottKnott.nb.html`: The HTML version of the above notebook.
* `scott-knott-results.png`: The results of the above.
* `scott-knott.py`: Dr. Menzies' Scott-Knott code.
* `scott-knott-results.txt`: Results from the above.
* `sk1.csv`: Input to Dr. Menzies' code. Results of the experiments. sknew refers to the experiment with parabolic activation.
* `03 - Non-monotonic activations.ipynb`: Tests with parabolic activation function.
* `sk-results-parabola`: Scott-Knott on the experiments above + the parabola experiments.
* `data-03.pkl`: The data generated in the 03 - notebook. This isn't really used anywhere; it's just saved.
